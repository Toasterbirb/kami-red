This will be frequently updated as long as I'm not on vacation or anything

This is by no means a finished project, nor is it a "cheat" or "hack" for anything, it is a *utility* mod.

Please note Baritone is no longer included. Download the standalone jar [from here](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases).

See [forgehax](https://github.com/fr1kin/forgehax) for an equivalent. Some features in KAMI may be based on those of forgehax, and KAMI / KAMI Blue have some features it doesn't. KAMI Blue won't be based off of other mods unless said otherwise.

## How do I

<details>
	<summary>Click to see the frequently asked questions or basic stuff</summary>

***

##### Open the GUI
Press Y.

##### Use commands
The default prefix is `.`. Commands are used through chat, use `.commands` for a list of commands.

##### Bind modules
Run `.bind <module> <key>`.

You can also use `.bind modifiers on` to allow modules to be bound to keybinds with modifiers, e.g `ctrl + shift + w` or `ctrl + c`.

##### Change command prefix
By using the command `prefix <prefix>` or after having ran KAMI Blue (make sure it's closed), editing your configuration file (find it using `config path` in-game) and changing the value of `commandPrefix` to change the prefix.
