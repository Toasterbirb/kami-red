## Looking for maintainers. 

Join the [Discord](https://kamiblue.org/discord) to contact a Council member. Check [l1ving's](https://github.com/l1ving) profile for alternate non-Discord contact methods. 

Due to this project rapidly expanding we're in need of Kotlin maintainers who can review pull requests and preferably have experience working with either Minecraft / Forge or GL before.
