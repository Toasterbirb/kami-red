# KAMI

A minecraft 'hacked' client in the form of a forge mod.

See [forgehax](https://github.com/fr1kin/forgehax) for a more polished equivalent. Some features in KAMI may be based on those of forgehax, as I sometimes used it as reference.

This is by no means a finished project and isn't fully ready for release.
